class BatchGenerator:

    A generator to generate batches of samples and corresponding labels indefinitely.

    Can shuffle the dataset consistently after each complete pass.

    Currently provides two methods to parse annotation data: A general-purpose CSV parser
    and an XML parser for the Pascal VOC datasets. If the annotations of your dataset are
    in a format that is not supported by these parsers, you could just add another parser
    method and still use this generator.

    Can perform image transformations for data conversion and data augmentation,
    for details please refer to the documentation of the `generate()` method.

        '''
        This class provides parser methods that you call separately after calling the constructor to assemble
        the list of image filenames and the list of labels for the dataset from CSV or XML files. If you already
        have the image filenames and labels in asuitable format (see argument descriptions below), you can pass
        them right here in the constructor, in which case you do not need to call any of the parser methods afterwards.

        In case you would like not to load any labels at all, simply pass a list of image filenames here.

        Arguments:
            box_output_format (list, optional): A list of five strings representing the desired order of the five
                items class ID, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax in the generated data. The expected strings are
                'xmin', 'xmax', 'ymin', 'ymax', 'class_id'. If you want to train the model, this
                must be the order that the box encoding class requires as input. Defaults to
                `['class_id', 'xmin', 'xmax', 'ymin', 'ymax']`. Note that even though the parser methods are
                able to produce different output formats, the SSDBoxEncoder currently requires the format
                `['class_id', 'xmin', 'xmax', 'ymin', 'ymax']`. This list only specifies the five box parameters
                that are relevant as training targets, a list of filenames is generated separately.
            filenames (string or list, optional): `None` or either a Python list/tuple or a string representing
                a filepath. If a list/tuple is passed, it must contain the file names (full paths) of the
                images to be used. Note that the list/tuple must contain the paths to the images,
                not the images themselves. If a filepath string is passed, it must point either to
                (1) a pickled file containing a list/tuple as described above. In this case the `filenames_type`
                argument must be set to `pickle`.
                Or
                (2) a text file. Each line of the text file contains the file name (basename of the file only,
                not the full directory path) to one image and nothing else. In this case the `filenames_type`
                argument must be set to `text` and you must pass the path to the directory that contains the
                images in `images_path`.
            filenames_type (string, optional): In case a string is passed for `filenames`, this indicates what
                type of file `filenames` is. It can be either 'pickle' for a pickled file or 'text' for a
                plain text file. Defaults to 'text'.
            images_path (string, optional): In case a text file is passed for `filenames`, the full paths to
                the images will be composed from `images_path` and the names in the text file, i.e. this
                should be the directory that contains the images to which the text file refers.
                If `filenames_type` is not 'text', then this argument is irrelevant. Defaults to `None`.
            labels (string or list, optional): `None` or either a Python list/tuple or a string representing
                the path to a pickled file containing a list/tuple. The list/tuple must contain Numpy arrays
                that represent the labels of the dataset.

                The class ID is an integer greater than zero. Class ID 0 is reserved for the background class.
                `xmin` and `xmax` are the left-most and right-most absolute horizontal coordinates of the box,
                `ymin` and `ymax` are the top-most and bottom-most absolute vertical coordinates of the box.

                defines the class IDs. Defaults to the list of Pascal VOC classes in alphabetical order.

        Generate batches of samples and corresponding labels indefinitely from
        lists of filenames and labels.

        Returns two Numpy arrays, one containing the next `batch_size` samples
        from `filenames`, the other containing the corresponding labels from
        `labels`.

        Can shuffle `filenames` and `labels` consistently after each complete pass.

        Can perform image transformations for data conversion and data augmentation.
        `resize`, `gray`, and `equalize` are image conversion tools and should be
        used consistently during training and inference. The remaining transformations
        serve for data augmentation. Each data augmentation process can set its own
        independent application probability. The transformations are performed
        in the order of their arguments, i.e. equalization is performed first,
        grayscale conversion is performed last.

        `prob` works the same way in all arguments in which it appears. It must be a float in [0,1]
        and determines the probability that the respective transform is applied to a given image.

        All conversions and transforms default to `False`.

        Arguments:
            batch_size (int, optional): The size of the batches to be generated. Defaults to 32.
            shuffle (bool, optional): Whether or not to shuffle the dataset before each pass. Defaults to `True`.
                This option should always be `True` during training, but it can be useful to turn shuffling off
                for debugging or if you're using the generator for prediction.
            train (bool, optional): Whether or not the generator is used in training mode. If `True`, then the labels
                will be transformed into the format that the SSD cost function requires. Otherwise,
                the output format of the labels is identical to the input format. Defaults to `True`.
            ssd_box_encoder (SSDBoxEncoder, optional): Only required if `train = True`. An SSDBoxEncoder object
                to encode the ground truth labels to the required format for training an SSD model.
            equalize (bool, optional): If `True`, performs histogram equalization on the images.
                This can improve contrast and lead the improved model performance.
            brightness (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple containing three floats, `(min, max, prob)`.
                Scales the brightness of the image by a factor randomly picked from a uniform
                distribution in the boundaries of `[min, max]`. Both min and max must be >=0.
            flip (float, optional): `False` or a float in [0,1], see `prob` above. Flip the image horizontally.
                The respective box coordinates are adjusted accordingly.
            translate (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple, with the first two elements tuples containing
                two integers each, and the third element a float: `((min, max), (min, max), prob)`.
                The first tuple provides the range in pixels for the horizontal shift of the image,
                the second tuple for the vertical shift. The number of pixels to shift the image
                by is uniformly distributed within the boundaries of `[min, max]`, i.e. `min` is the number
                of pixels by which the image is translated at least. Both `min` and `max` must be >=0.
                The respective box coordinates are adjusted accordingly.
            scale (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple containing three floats, `(min, max, prob)`.
                Scales the image by a factor randomly picked from a uniform distribution in the boundaries
                of `[min, max]`. Both min and max must be >=0.
            max_crop_and_resize (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of four integers, `(height, width, min_1_object, max_#_trials)`.
                This will crop out the maximal possible image patch with an aspect ratio defined by `height` and `width` from the
                input image and then resize the resulting patch to `(height, width)`. The latter two components of the tuple work
                identically as in `random_crop`. Note the difference to `random_crop`: This operation crops patches of variable size
                and fixed aspect ratio from the input image and then resizes the patch, while `random_crop` crops patches of fixed
                size and fixed aspect ratio from the input image. If this operation is active, it overrides both
                `random_crop` and `resize`.
            full_crop_and_resize (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of four integers and one float,
                `(height, width, min_1_object, max_#_trials, mix_ratio)`. This will generate a patch of size `(height, width)`
                that always contains the full input image. The latter third and fourth components of the tuple work identically as
                in `random_crop`. `mix_ratio` is only relevant if `max_crop_and_resize` is active, in which case it must be a float in
                `[0, 1]` that decides what ratio of images will be processed using `max_crop_and_resize` and what ratio of images
                will be processed using `full_crop_and_resize`. If `mix_ratio` is 1, all images will be processed using `full_crop_and_resize`.
                Note the difference to `max_crop_and_resize`: While `max_crop_and_resize` will crop out the largest possible patch
                that still lies fully within the input image, the patch generated here will always contain the full input image.
                If this operation is active, it overrides both `random_crop` and `resize`.
            random_crop (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of four integers, `(height, width, min_1_object, max_#_trials)`,
                where `height` and `width` are the height and width of the patch that is to be cropped out at a random
                position in the input image. Note that `height` and `width` can be arbitrary - they are allowed to be larger
                than the image height and width, in which case the original image will be randomly placed on a black background
                canvas of size `(height, width)`. `min_1_object` is either 0 or 1. If 1, there must be at least one detectable
                object remaining in the image for the crop to be valid, and if 0, crops with no detectable objects left in the
                image patch are allowed. `max_#_trials` is only relevant if `min_1_object == 1` and sets the maximum number
                of attempts to get a valid crop. If no valid crop was obtained within this maximum number of attempts,
                the respective image will be removed from the batch without replacement (i.e. for each removed image, the batch
                will be one sample smaller). Defaults to `False`.
            crop (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of four integers, `(crop_top, crop_bottom, crop_left, crop_right)`,
                with the number of pixels to crop off of each side of the images.
                The targets are adjusted accordingly. Note: Cropping happens before resizing.
            resize (tuple, optional): `False` or a tuple of 2 integers for the desired output
                size of the images in pixels. The expected format is `(height, width)`.
                The box coordinates are adjusted accordingly. Note: Resizing happens after cropping.
            gray (bool, optional): If `True`, converts the images to grayscale. Note that the resulting grayscale
                images have shape `(height, width, 1)`.
            limit_boxes (bool, optional): If `True`, limits box coordinates to stay within image boundaries
                post any transformation. This should always be set to `True`, even if you set `include_thresh`
                to 0. I don't even know why I made this an option. If this is set to `False`, you could
                end up with some boxes that lie entirely outside the image boundaries after a given transformation
                and such boxes would of course not make any sense and have a strongly adverse effect on the learning.
            include_thresh (float, optional): Only relevant if `limit_boxes` is `True`. Determines the minimum
                fraction of the area of a ground truth box that must be left after limiting in order for the box
                to still be included in the batch data. If set to 0, all boxes are kept except those which lie
                entirely outside of the image bounderies after limiting. If set to 1, only boxes that did not
                need to be limited at all are kept. Defaults to 0.3.
            diagnostics (bool, optional): If `True`, yields three additional output items:
                1) A list of the image file names in the batch.
                2) An array with the original, unaltered images.
                3) A list with the original, unaltered labels.
                This can be useful for diagnostic purposes. Defaults to `False`. Only works if `train = True`.

        Yields:
            The next batch as either of
            (1) a 3-tuple containing a Numpy array that contains the images, a Python list
            that contains the corresponding labels for each image as 2D Numpy arrays, and another Python list
            that contains the file names of the images in the batch. This is the case if `train==False`
            and labels are available.
            (2) a 2-tuple containing a Numpy array that contains the images and a Python list
            that contains the file names of the images in the batch. This is the case if `train==False`
            and labels are not available.
            (3) a 2-tuple containing a Numpy array that contains the images and another Numpy array with the
            labels in the format that `SSDBoxEncoder.encode_y()` returns, namely an array with shape
            `(batch_size, #boxes, #classes + 4 + 4 + 4)`, where `#boxes` is the total number of
            boxes predicted by the model per image and the last axis contains
            `[one-hot vector for the classes, 4 ground truth coordinate offsets, 4 anchor box coordinates, 4 variances]`.
            The format and order of the box coordinates is according to the `box_output_format` that was specified
            in the `BachtGenerator` constructor.

        Perform offline image processing.

        This function has mostly the same image processing capabilities as the generator function above,
        but it performs the processing on all items in `filenames` starting at index `start`
        until index `stop` and saves the processed images to disk. The labels are adjusted
        accordingly.

        Processing images offline is useful to reduce the amount of work done by the batch
        generator and thus can speed up training. For example, transformations that are performed
        on all images in a deterministic way, such as resizing or cropping, should be done offline.

        Arguments:
            dest_path (str, optional): The destination directory where the processed images
                and `labels.csv` should be saved, ending on a slash.
            start (int, optional): The inclusive start index from which onward to process the
                items in `filenames`. Defaults to 0.
            stop (int, optional): The exclusive stop index until which to process the
                items in `filenames`. Defaults to 'all', meaning to process all items until the
                end of the list.

        For a description of the other arguments, please refer to the documentation of `generate_batch()` above.

        Returns:
            `None`, but saves all processed images as JPEG files to the specified destination
            directory and generates a `labels.csv` CSV file that is saved to the same directory.
            The format of the lines in the destination CSV file is the same as that of the
            source CSV file, i.e. `[frame, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, class_id]`.
